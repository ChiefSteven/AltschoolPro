        <i>Biography:</i><br />

        I am an individual with a diverse background in Maritime Management
        Technology, a graduate of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri
        (FUTO). Over the years, I have developed a deep passion for sailing,
        which has motivated me to pursue further academic exploration in the
        field of maritime studies. My journey has extended beyond just academic
        achievements; it has evolved into a multifaceted career aspiration that
        merges maritime expertise with technology, particularly in the realm of
        software development. Currently, I am focused on enhancing my software
        development skills, particularly in web development, with an eye toward
        applying them to the maritime sector. Additionally, I serve as a
        clinical chess coach and ambassador for 'The Gift of Chess,' an American
        NGO, which has allowed me to enhance my leadership and strategic
        thinking capabilities. This unique combination of interests has driven
        me to explore new avenues where technology and maritime studies
        intersect.

        <i>Why I Joined the Program: </i><br> My decision to join the School of Engineering
        program stems from my desire to deepen my understanding of engineering
        principles and technologies. I believe that the future of the maritime
        industry will be significantly shaped by engineering innovations, and I
        want to position myself to contribute to these advancements. The program
        will allow me to explore how engineering solutions can optimize maritime
        systems, improve navigation technologies, and enhance the integration of
        software solutions into maritime operations. Moreover, the program
        aligns perfectly with my long-term goals of bridging the gap between
        maritime expertise and technological advancements. I see this program as
        an opportunity to not only advance my technical knowledge but also to
        engage with a broader network of professionals, researchers, and experts
        who share my vision for the future of maritime and engineering.
